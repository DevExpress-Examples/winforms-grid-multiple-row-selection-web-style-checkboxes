' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' Multiple selection using checkbox (web style)
' 
' The following example shows how to implement multiple selection in the web style
' (via check boxes). The XtraGrid does not have this functionality built-in. The
' GridCheckMarksSelection class allows you to implement it. End-users can
' select/unselect rows, group rows or select/unselect all rows by clicking on the
' column header. Changing check box value does not start row editing. This example
' is based on the http://www.devexpress.com/scid=A371 article.
